//! base: CCYNC foundation crate.
//!
//! Owns configuration truth, install mode resolution, install-state ledger,
//! path location resolution, shared JSON/env utilities, runtime selection
//! helpers, and shared serde data-model types (MCP manifest types).
//! This crate depends on no other CCYNC crate — it is the dependency-law
//! foundation: every other CCYNC crate may depend on `base`, never the reverse.
